The properties you need to add to each element are:

* **All odd numbered elements**: a light red/pink background, and a list of fonts containing `Verdana` and `DejaVu Sans` with `sans-serif` as a fallback
* **The second element**: blue text and a font size of 36px
* **The third element**: in addition to the styles for all odd numbered elements, add a font size of 24px
* **The fourth element**: a light green background, a font size of 24px, and bold

Quick tip: in VS Code, you can change which format colors are displayed in RGB, HEX, or HSL by hovering over the color value in the CSS and clicking the top of the popup that appears!

> ### Note:
> Part of your task is to add a font to _some_ of these items. Your browser's font's might be different than the one displayed in the desired outcome image. As long as you confirm that the fonts _are_ being applied to the right lines any differences are okay for this exercise.
